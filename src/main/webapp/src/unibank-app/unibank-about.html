                Hi, my name is Sujai Nair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born in '92, I grew up in Mumbai, graduated from Sangli in 2013 and have been working in Amsterdam since 2015. I studied Electronics during my 4years
                of graduation, got interested in Software development and now I work as a DevOps Engineer at ING Bank while being employed by TCS.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my life I have loved challenges, from building structures with those toy building blocks, making race tracks with electrical tubing, solving math
                in school, building a robot in college to today when I decided to create this app. These challenges help me learn and more importantly, I love the sense
                of achievement at the end. In recent times <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Elon+Musk">Elon Musk</a> has been my greatest role model; he is
                one of the best engineers trying to solve some of the biggest challenges humanity is facing today.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my spare time, when I am not working on this app, I usually prefer to learn about the cosmos. I spend hours watching videos of
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Neil+deGrasse+Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> and feel a sense of absolute high. From the physics that
                govern this universe to the theories that seem like a child's imagination at work, the cosmos holds amazing mysteries that seem to be
                from a Science Fiction movie.<br/>
                When I am specially elated or inspired, I also tend to write down a few lines of poetry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I have been looking for some better challenges at work, so if you have an opportunity open, you would surely be interested in my
                <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B44MtjehIg75Z1pfem52alpqQmc">résumé</a>. You can get in touch with me via
                <a href="mailto:nair.sujai@gmail.com">mail</a> any time.
